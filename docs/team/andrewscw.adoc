== Overview


UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. To improve the quality of student life in computing, UltiStudent provides a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

My role was to design and write the codes for the features in the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) manager. THe following sections of this document
illustrate the enhancement i made and also

Do note the following callouts and formatting used in this document.

[WARNING]
This callout indicates that there is worth being cautioned of. You are encouraged to the read information in here.
If you are not careful, you may encounter problems.

=== Definitions of Terms
Across our project and documents, the term `cap entry` is used a lot, especially so for the CAP Manager.
In our Developer Guide and Code, we use this term `cap entry` to refer to what the CAP Manager stores and keeps track
of. This was done intentionally to avoid confusion for developers as the NotesManager and HomeworkManager of UltiStudent
both store and organise documents by the module the document is for.
However, we are aware that to the users, it is more intuitive to consider that the CAP manager stores modules and keep
tracks of the grades of the said modules, hence in our User Guide, we describe module as what the CAP manager stores.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=andrewscw&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-14&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense]

* *Major enhancement*: Developed the logic, model and storage components of the CAP manager feature of UltiStudent.
Which allow users to record the modules they have taken and the grades they received. This lets users keep track and forecast their CAP score.

** What it does: CAP Manager allows users to add, delete and edit cap entries. The CAP Manager also automatically calculates
the user's CAP score whenever a change is made in the CAP manager. CAP Manager also allows users to filter through the
cap entries they have taken by the semester by the `find-sem` command.

** Justification: The ability to create cap entry depends on the CAP manager infrastructure. The infrastructure is
a core component that of CAP manager, without which the CAP manager will fail to function. The infrastructure of the
CAP manager also important to allow for future developments and extensions of the application.
The commands (add-cap, edit-cap, edit-cap-mc, delete-cap, find-sem, list-cap) of CAP manager act on the model of CAP manager
which are initiated and executed the logic component of CAP Manager which then interacts with the logic component of UltiStudent.


** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
This requires a thorough understanding of the starting infrastructure of the application in other to make changes to it.
The implementation was challenging because I had to work within the restrictions of the of the existing application, this was especially so for the CAP calculation feature.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** *Add Cap entry* command that adds cap entries into the CAP Manager, which in turns updates the Module Semester list and CAP score.
** *Edit Cap entry* command that edits the parameters of a cap entry, which in turns updates the Module Semester list and CAP score.
** *Delete Cap entry* command that deletes the cap entry from the cap manager, which in turns updates the Module Semester list and CAP score..
** *Find Cap entry* command that looks for and displays  all notes in the Notes Manager.
** *List Cap entry* command that lists all notes in the Notes Manager.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Ensured loose coupling between each manager and seamless integration of CAP manager into UltiStudent.
